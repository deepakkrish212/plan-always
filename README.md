# Plan-Always
This is the modification of the [Bolzano-Weistrass Plan](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan). I will update my life rules and statues here to get those sweet green points

## Rules
- Don't use your phone when doing important work. **Life is to live, not get distracted**.
- Hit the gym and be healthy. **After all, a man's true potential is unlocked only when he takes care of himself**.
- Meditate everyday. **You need to think about everything that is going on around you and sometimes not**.
- Plan your day. **In this busy and hectic world, being organized is the key to success**
- Be kind and grateful. **What is the point of being not kind and bratty?**
- Don't give in to your addictions. **A man who is addicted will forever be a slave**.

| 9   | Success - New Chapter | I am tired of being the same. I convinced myself that losing is a part of the journey and I shouldn't feel bad. That's not true. I worked hard for it and I didn't succeed. So, the only possible solution for that is to feel that pain and DO MORE WORK. What's the point of pursuing something if you are not going to be best at it? That's exactly what I am going to do. I am going to be the best in my field. In other words, I am going to be the best entreprenuer/software engineer the world has ever seen. I used to have motivation burts just like this in the past: they are not sustianable. However, this is not just a burst of motivation I am feeling right now. It is more than that, It is my identity from now on. I am going to be the BEST OF THE BEST, and I will make that happen. This is not just a promise but also my life. | --------- | ------- | 09/21/2023 |

| 2   | Success (Partial) | Today was busy but good. Felt very productive but very tiring due to not enough sleep. Lost rock papers scissors to Soobin and had to book the cab to the airport. Packed and ready for HackMIT :) I also learned more about flutter to assist my team at the competiton. Applying to HarvardHack - hopefully I get accepted :) (fingers crossed). | I am still holding on buddy | Again, try to organize yourself better man. Plan out your day but you never do. Start doing that. Also, work on your body and keep it healthy - you only got one body for this life. | 09/14/2023 |
| 1   | Success (Partial) | I was able to get some work done at Raven; HackMIT planning went well; Classes went well; Should focus more on GardenMate :( |The phone addiciton was strong but I controlled myself to the best of my abilities. | Trying to avoid your phone is really hard. Therefore, make a plan the day before, try to stick to it as much as possible. If you feel the urge is getting stronger, just take a break and go on a walk buddy boy | 09/13/2023 |
