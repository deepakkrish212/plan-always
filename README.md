Throughout this last year, I have learned a lot about myself. I travelled to a different country, improved my confidence, and also let go of some of the important aspects of my life. Overall, I have not been living the life that I have always wanted to live. I sought "moment-based" pleasures rather than overall life satisfaction, and I now realize that is not where I want to be in life. Therefore, I am hoping from this moment, I can start to live by the principles that I set for myself a long time ago in this [plan](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan)

It feels almost weird to start this plan again, since it's been a year since I started my previous one. However, as my GOAT, Nick Eh 30 said, "Never Back Down, Never What?" NEVER GIVE UP!

**Life Principles**
- No usage of mobile phone during focus times unless it is an emergency. Focus times include work time, study time, or any other dedicated times. (Live in the Present)
- Gym for at least 5 days every week, and calorie intake of 2500 - 3000 calories per day based on the heaviest meal calorie count of the day. (Take Care of Your Internal Temple)
- Calm and center yourself by observing the reality as it is. In other words, do meditation


Wish me luck friends!

| Day | Status | Notes | Why fail? (don't) | Feedback | Date |
| --- | ------ | ----- | --------- | -------- | -------|
| 1 | Done | Focused on the work at hand. I did all of the things mentioned in my life principles; however, I also played video games (Valorant) till 2 am, which made me realize that I could have used my time more productively. | --------- | Try to limit your gaming time. Remember, it's just pixels moving in a screen. They don't actually have an impact on your life satisfaction goals. | 09/24/2025 |
| 0 | Done | Started the day slow, but I think I got everything I wanted done | --------- | Remember to live in the present. And, Self Control is a finite resource so use it wisely | 09/23/2024 |
