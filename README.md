# Plan-Always
This is the modification of the [Bolzano-Weistrass Plan](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan). I will update my life rules and statues here to get those sweet green points

## Rules
- Don't use your phone when doing important work. **Life is to live, not get distracted**.
- Hit the gym and be healthy. **After all, a man's true potential is unlocked only when he takes care of himself**.
- Meditate everyday. **You need to think about everything that is going on around you and sometimes not**.
- Plan your day. **In this busy and hectic world, being organized is the key to success**
- Be kind and grateful. **What is the point of being not kind and bratty?**
- Don't give in to your addictions. **A man who is addicted will forever be a slave**.

| 1   | Success (Partial) | I was able to get some work done at Raven; HackMIT planning went well; Classes went well; Should focus more on GardenMate :( |The phone addiciton was strong but I controlled myself to the best of my abilities. | Trying to avoid your phone is really hard. Therefore, make a plan the day before, try to stick to it as much as possible. If you feel the urge is getting stronger, just take a break and go on a walk buddy boy | 09/13/2023 |
