# Plan-Always
This is the modification of the [Bolzano-Weistrass Plan](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan). I will update my life rules and statues here to get those sweet green points.

Update **09/22/2023**
I realized that, in order to be the best of the best, I need to be willing to go the extra mile. I need to idenitfy my strenghts and weaknesses and constantly improve them. For this, I introduce a set of additions as follows:
- Create a skillset table and rate yourself from 0 - 10 based on your current skill levels
- Every two weeks, update that skillset table. However, in those two weeks, you will do as much as you can to improve the individual skills mentioned
- A status table will also be created just for updating the skillsets and any feedback that I might have for myself.
- At the end of two weeks, I will also report what new intiatives or improvements I have made to evolve myself to the next level.

## Skillset
| Skill | Level (0-10) | How to improve | Date | Week |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------- | -----| -----|
| Typing| 5.5          | Practice typing everyday for atleast 10 minutes | 09/22/2023 | 0 |
| Problem solving| 6   | Practice competitve programming everyday for atleast 10 minutes | 09/22/2023 | 0 |
| Programming from logic| 3.0 | Create psuedocode and code it up | 09/22/2023 | 0 |
| Programming | 5.0 | Practice coding without the help of AI assistants | 09/22/2023 | 0 |
| Health and Physique | 2.0 | Improve sleep schedule and Gym consistent | 09/22/2023 | 0 |
| Speaking and Writing| 4.0 | Practice speaking and writing everyday for at least 10 minutes | 09/22/2023 | 0 |
| Plan and Following  | 0.5 | If you have a plan, you are going to stick to it. No other option | 09/22/2023 | 0 |

## Actions for evolution (Week 0 WIP)

## Things to avoid
  - Stop getting a sense of accomplishment from planning. You are just planning or dreaming about it and not actually doing it
  - When tired, don't give up.
  - Never rely on motivation. You don't have any motivation, you only have discipline and will power. 

## Rules
- Don't use your phone when doing important work. **Life is to live, not get distracted**.
- Hit the gym and be healthy. **After all, a man's true potential is unlocked only when he takes care of himself**.
- Meditate everyday. **You need to think about everything that is going on around you and sometimes not**.
- Plan your day. **In this busy and hectic world, being organized is the key to success**
- Be kind and grateful. **What is the point of being not kind and bratty?**
- Don't give in to your addictions. **A man who is addicted will forever be a slave**.
- I should go above and beyond in any given circumstance. **Life is to be extraordinary**

## Punishment
  - If I didn't not follow any of my daily rules, I have to solve two leetcode medium level questions. I am allowed to look at the hint after 30 minutes but never the solution.
      - If I didn't follow this, I will also have to send Soobin $100
  - My ego is not satisfied with lying. I am not satisfied with lying. I cannot truly evolve if I lie. So, lying will cost me $100 dollars straight to Soobin's account
  - If I do not do anything major to improve my life in these two weeks' time, I have failed and have to do leetcode questions for an entire day.
      - Failing this will also initiate a $100 transfer to Soobin. 

## Status
| Day | Status | Notes | Why fail? (don't) | Feedback | Date |
| --- | ------ | ----- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| 9   | Success - New Chapter | I am tired of being the same. I convinced myself that losing is a part of the journey and I shouldn't feel bad. That's not true. I worked hard for it and I didn't succeed. So, the only possible solution for that is to feel that pain and DO MORE WORK. What's the point of pursuing something if you are not going to be best at it? That's exactly what I am going to do. I am going to be the best in my field. In other words, I am going to be the best entreprenuer/software engineer the world has ever seen. I used to have motivation burts just like this in the past: they are not sustianable. However, this is not just a burst of motivation I am feeling right now. It is more than that, It is my identity from now on. I am going to be the BEST OF THE BEST, and I will make that happen. This is not just a promise but also my life. | --------- | ------- | 09/21/2023 |

Packed and ready for HackMIT :) I also learned more about flutter to assist my team at the competiton. Applying to HarvardHack - hopefully I get accepted :) (fingers crossed). | I am still holding on buddy | Again, try to organize yourself better man. Plan out your day but you never do. Start doing that. Also, work on your body and keep it healthy - you only got one body for this life. | 09/14/2023 |
| 1   | Success (Partial) | I was able to get some work done at Raven; HackMIT planning went well; Classes went well; Should focus more on GardenMate :( |The phone addiciton was strong but I controlled myself to the best of my abilities. | Trying to avoid your phone is really hard. Therefore, make a plan the day before, try to stick to it as much as possible. If you feel the urge is getting stronger, just take a break and go on a walk buddy boy | 09/13/2023 |
