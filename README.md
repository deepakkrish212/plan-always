Throughout this last year, I have learned a lot about myself. I travelled to a different country, improved my confidence, and also let go of some of the important aspects of my life. Overall, I have not been living the life that I have always wanted to live. I sought "moment-based" pleasures rather than overall life satisfaction, and I now realize that is not where I want to be in life. Therefore, I am hoping from this moment, I can start to live by the principles that I set for myself a long time ago in this [plan](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan)

It feels almost weird to start this plan again, since it's been a year since I started my previous one. However, as my GOAT, Nick Eh 30 said, "Never Back Down, Never What?" NEVER GIVE UP!

**Life Principles**
- No usage of mobile phone during focus times unless it is an emergency. Focus times include work time, study time, or any other dedicated times. (Live in the Present)
- Gym for at least 5 days every week, and calorie intake of 2500 - 3000 calories per day based on the heaviest meal calorie count of the day. (Take Care of Your Internal Temple)
- Calm and center yourself by observing the reality as it is. In other words, do meditation


Wish me luck friends!

| 6 | Not Done | I woke up very late today as well and just stayed in my room all day. I ordered out food worth 50 bucks and just played Valorant all day. Overall, today was not productive at all. However, I am not going to let this hold me back. I am getting back on track as I am writing this out. | --------- | | 09/29/2024 |
|5 | Not Done | I woke up very late and didn't work on anything that I was supposed to work on | --------- | Don't try to have cheat meals. Rather, just have good food anytime you want but control the portions and make sure that it is actually good for you | 09/28/2024 |
| 4 | Done | I watched a movie (Weathering With You) with my friends and had a cheat meal | --------- | | 09/27/2024 |
| 3 | Done | I finished most of my school work, and tried to attend all of my classes, and paid full attention while being in class. I understand how it feels to be "locked in" when doing something. The world becomes silent, and the only things that exist are just you and the thing that you are working on. It is a blissful experience. However, I did end up playing Valorant after Gym, but only till 12:30 am today so, I guess that's a win compared to yesterday?| --------- | Again, I have noticed that I give into my urges as I get tired throughout the day. The solution to this restlessness might just be taking a nap in the afternoo. | 09/25/2024 |
| 2 | Done | I think this day was a bit more productive than yesterday but I still need to focus more on my life goals instead of video games | --------- | Try to limit your gaming time. Remember, it's just pixels moving in a screen. They don't actually have an impact on your life satisfaction goals. | 09/25/2024 |
| 1 | Done | Focused on the work at hand. I did all of the things mentioned in my life principles; however, I also played video games (Valorant) till 2 am, which made me realize that I could have used my time more productively. | --------- | Try to limit your gaming time. Remember, it's just pixels moving in a screen. They don't actually have an impact on your life satisfaction goals. | 09/24/2024 |
| 0 | Done | Started the day slow, but I think I got everything I wanted done | --------- | Remember to live in the present. And, Self Control is a finite resource so use it wisely | 09/23/2024 |
